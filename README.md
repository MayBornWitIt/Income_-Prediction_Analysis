Brief Description of Data

'Stroke Prediction Dataset' is a binary classification dataset which will be experimented with models. We will use this dataset to demonstrate how to evaluate a classification model on a binary classification problem. Each record in this dataset correlates to patients risk of strokes and each feature represents health factors of an individual.

Our task will be to create a model that predicts an individual's risk of stroke based on the their personal health factors.

## Methods

- Logistic Regression Modeling
- K-Nearest Neighbors Modeling
