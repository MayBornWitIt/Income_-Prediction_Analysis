Brief Description of Data

'Stroke Prediction Dataset' is a binary classification dataset which will be experimented with models. We will use this dataset to demonstrate how to evaluate a classification model on a binary classification problem. Each record in this dataset correlates to patients risk of strokes and each feature represents health factors of an individual.

Our task will be to create a model that predicts an individual's risk of stroke based on the their personal health factors.

Some challenges one may foresee while cleaning, exploring and modeling this dataset can be the following:
- Data Leakage
- Duplicated, Inconsistent, and/or Missing values
- Class Imbalances
- False Predictions and Sampling Errors


## Methods

- Logistic Regression Modeling

Confusion Matrices
