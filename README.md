# INCOME PREDICTION ANALYSIS
Author: Maybelline Monge


## PROJECT OBJECTIVE
Explore data and recommend a machine learning model that targets predicting whether an adult's salary crosses a threshhold of $50k or higher, yes or no.

## DATASET DESCRIPTION
Source: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wenruliu/adult-income-dataset)

'Adult Income' is a binary classification dataset that classifies an adult's income level based on various demographical attributes. Each row in this dataset provides statistical information pertaining to income level, and each column represents a demographic feature of an individual.


## ANALYTICAL INSIGHTS

![pie](https://github.com/MayBornWitIt/Income_-Prediction_Analysis/assets/126980733/72e2ceb4-4f30-41ce-a619-03363093077e)

Based on the pie graph above, it displays about 75% of adults in the dataset make less than 50k. Whereas, only 25% make over 50k. This tells me the dataset is unbalanced.

Based on the boxplot above, the 'age' feature appears to have outliers from 47 years of age and beyond 75. Median recorded age in the dataset being 37.

Based on the barplot above, it displays the majority of adults between the ages of 40-50 as self employed making a salary over 50K.
Whereas, majority of young adults in the private sector make a salary less than 50k.

Based on the plot displayed above, there is a great disparity between income and race distinction. Notable information.

This plot shows a correlation between income as related to education. This yields some interesting trends with regard to the educational backgrounds that have an income greater than 50k.

## SUMMARY & RECOMMENDATION
Given the results of the various explored models, it's suggested that the Tuned Logistic Regression Model is the best production model for the business problem at hand. The model accuracy score being the highest at 83% implies it's the highest predictive model with the most number of samples that display out to be in the positive class. As this is a classification task of whether the income in the sample crosses a threshhold of 50k or higher, yes or no, this metric yields the most value with fewer false positives.
